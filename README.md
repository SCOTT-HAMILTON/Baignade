<h1 align="center">Baignade - Android Widget to visualize sea tides at a glance</h1>

## Description
Baignade lets you choose which port you want to follow and it will create a modern graph showing the past, current and next few tides for this specific location as well as the tide coefficient and the water temperature (in degrees of course XD).

Baignade (a swim in french) uses data provided by the French Naval Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service (Service Hydrographique et Oc√©anographique de la Marine), the SHOM in short.

The SHOM provides a wide range of ports, so big that we can't visualize them all without crashing your 4G ram device XD. So when trying to select a location on the map, don't get scared if you can't select anything, the ports are showing at your location only once you stopped zooming or scrolling for more than 2 seconds.
